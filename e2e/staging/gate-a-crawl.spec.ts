/**
 * Gate A runtime crawl. THIS FILE IS THIN ON PURPOSE.
 *
 * The machinery lives in @predivo-gmbh/gate-kit/crawl: one implementation for the whole fleet,
 * with its own fixture suite covering every way this crawler has actually lied (a modal counted
 * 35 times, an auto-opening modal it could never reach, a route crawled blind behind an
 * undismissable overlay, discovery that only ran at desktop width, a trigger whose accessible
 * name it could not resolve). What belongs here is only what is different about THIS product,
 * and that all lives in gate-a.config.ts.
 *
 * The previous 593-line copy of the machinery is gone. It had the same defects the other five
 * copies had, which is the whole argument for there being one of it.

/**
 * Gate A runtime crawl against the DEPLOYED staging site.
 *
 * Kept in its OWN config, separate from playwright.v11-gates.config.ts: the crawl is
 * long-running and READ-ONLY by design (it measures the commit control in every dialog it
 * finds and never clicks one, and never clicks anything on the denylists in the spec,
 * including the AI-assistant chips that would each bill a paid Anthropic call).
 *
 * staging.valrano.com sits behind HTTP basic auth. WITHOUT httpCredentials every route
 * returns a 401 page and the crawl reports zero triggers, which reads exactly like a clean
 * app. That is not hypothetical: ChannelMover's recon did precisely that on 2026-08-20.
 *
 * Run locally (magiclink path, no password needed):
 *   STAGING_HTTP_USER=staging STAGING_HTTP_PASS=... VAL_SVC_KEY=eyJ... \
 *   npx playwright test --config playwright.gate-a-crawl.config.ts
